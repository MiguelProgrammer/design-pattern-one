# Design pattern | one

The implementation of a concept in fact is to help those who need a demand to be met, 
the construction and operation of this is in fact important, therefore, it is necessary
to analyze and be careful when building, today there are standardized concepts so 
that at least the implementation and functionality is cohesive and of low complexity.

This is a study and practice of design patterns, in addition to these, solid and taken
into account, there may be times when some concept comes into conflict and the resolution 
will depend on the problem to be addressed and this is from application to application. 
With all this, I believe that my critical and analytical side will be sharper.
